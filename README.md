Python-Challenge
Module 3

My PyBank code was mainly created by searching through our solved activity files from the Python class activities. I also created and participated in a zoom meeting with 6 other classmates in which we discussed strategy and possible loops and function we could use to find the answers. I had most of my code completed but was greatly helped by Jesse Wright in a tutor session to help me process how I had my code set-up. Mainly which variables were inside and outside of my loop to create the right run of code. I did google a lot of errors and some code. I did use this youtube video to help with ideas on calculating averages and finding percentages.

My PyPoll code was mainly created by using the solved examples from our activities folder again. I also reviewed the zoom recording on Day 2 of Python. I used the following websites to help with coding errors and debugs: 

This site taught me how to use the .3f function for my percentage calcuation.

This site helped me review 'for' loops to compare 2 values.

I also worked with a tutor on my PyPoll to help with my final loop within the dictionary. Mothanna Battah was very helpful in giving me an example to follow and then allowing me to work the code through in my head. We had a good discussion about why certain functions were being performed when I didn't think I needed them.

My final help came from a Learning Assistant, Bigyan. He helped me de-bug a code error that had to do with my indent and inability to run my code effectively.
